<h1>Splunk- Real-Time Log Analysis and Monitoring Dashboards </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates how to use Splunk Enterprise to ingest, analyze, and visualize log data through interactive tables and dashboards. The lab setup walks through creating data inputs, running queries, and building custom dashboards based on application, system, and security logs to monitor system performance and security events. Splunk will be used in my home lab setup as the main SIEM tool.
